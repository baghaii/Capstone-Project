# Alumni Connector
Alumni Connector is the capstone project for the Android Nanogree program. The proposal for this project can be found in [Capstone_Stage1.pdf](Capstone_Stage1.pdf).

In this project, I am using ButterKnife for the first time and Firebase database and authorization for the first time.
